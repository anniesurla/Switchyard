//! Stage-router scoring and tier selection — the shared routing core.
//!
//! Given a [`ToolSignals`] (extracted by the dimension collector), this
//! module decides whether a coding-agent turn should go to the **capable**
//! (strong) or **efficient** (weak) tier. It is the single source of truth for
//! the decision, shared by the Rust profile and the Python processor via
//! bindings — only the outer shell differs in how it fetches the decision.
//!
//! Two axes:
//!
//! * **error** — did the recent tool results error? (`severity`)
//! * **production** — is the agent producing code? (`spinning` / `exploring`
//!   push toward capable; `production_intensity` pushes toward efficient)
//!
//! Signals are scored with fixed weights, summed, and `tanh`-squashed into
//! `(-1, +1)`; `confidence` is the magnitude. The `confidence_threshold` dials
//! how much corroboration a decisive escalation needs (see [`score_signal`]).
